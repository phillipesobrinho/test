<h2>Subject: Site down, are your nameservers down?</h2>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out — I understand how stressful it is when your site isn't reachable. I checked Cloudflare’s nameservers and they are all fully operational globally at this time.</p>

<p>Since you're seeing reachability issues across different networks, here’s how I’d approach it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, I’d check your domain’s DNS resolution using <strong>dig</strong> or <strong>nslookup</strong>. If your domain is correctly pointing to Cloudflare’s nameservers, we should get responses with <code>ns1.cloudflare.com</code> and <code>ns2.cloudflare.com</code>.</li>
  <li>If you’re using Cloudflare DNS, I’ll inspect your DNS settings in the Cloudflare dashboard to confirm that your A or CNAME records are resolving correctly to your origin server.</li>
  <li>Next, I’d look at propagation using <a href="https://dnschecker.org" target="_blank">DNSChecker.org</a> to ensure there’s no issue with global DNS visibility.</li>
</ol>

<p>If everything is configured correctly but you’re still having issues, we may want to investigate network-level blocks or any firewall rules at Cloudflare or your origin.</p>

<p><strong>Tools I'd use:</strong> dig, nslookup, DNSChecker, Cloudflare Analytics & DNS settings</p>

<p>Let me know your domain if you'd like me to dig in further!</p>
